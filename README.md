# Can I Eat This? 🍎

**Can I Eat This?** is a nutrition app concept designed to make dieting simpler and less stressful.  
When you’re following a specific eating style—like low-fat, keto, gluten-free, or plant-based—the hardest part is knowing what’s safe to eat. This app solves that by letting you quickly search any food and get a clear, diet-specific answer.  

Instead of digging through conflicting articles, just type:  
> “Can I eat avocados?”  

You’ll instantly see **Yes, No, or In Moderation**, with a short explanation and healthier alternatives.
